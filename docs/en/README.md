```
# Margin: Adjust GPU frequency calculation margin percentage
Margin=5
# Freq Volt DDR_OPP
218000 45000 999
280000 46875 999
350000 48750 999
431000 49375 999
471000 50625 999
532000 51875 999
573000 53125 2
634000 55000 1
685000 56875 1
755000 59375 0
853000 60625 0
```

**Configuration Parameter Explanation**:
- **Freq**: GPU frequency (KHz)
- **Volt**: Voltage (ŒºV)
- **DDR_OPP**: Memory frequency level (999 means no adjustment, 0-3 represent different levels)
- **Margin**: Frequency calculation margin percentage (adjustable through WebUI or direct configuration file editing)

**Preset Configuration Files**:
- `config/mtd720.conf` - Dimensity 720 series
- `config/mtd1000.conf` - Dimensity 1000 series
- `config/mtd1100.conf` - Dimensity 1100 series
- `config/mtd1200.conf` - Dimensity 1200 series
- `config/mtd8100.conf` - Dimensity 8100 series
- `config/mtd8200.conf` - Dimensity 8200 series
- `config/mtd9000.conf` - Dimensity 9000 series

### Game List Configuration

The game list configuration file is located at `/data/adb/gpu_governor/game/games.conf`, containing application package names that need game mode applied. The module will automatically scan installed games on the device and generate this configuration file during installation.

**Note**: The installation script will check if the game list file already exists. If it exists, it will not be overwritten to preserve user custom settings.

### Interactive Control Menu

The module provides an `action.sh` script supporting interactive operations through volume keys:

**Script Functions**:
- **Control Governor Service**: Start or stop GPU governor service
- **Set Log Level**: Choose debug, info, warn, or error level
- **View Module Status**: Display module version, running status, etc.
- **Log Management**: Automatic log rotation to prevent log files from becoming too large

**Important Change**: Starting from v2.7, the `action.sh` script no longer supports manual game mode switching. Game mode completely relies on automatic detection of application package names configured in `games.conf`.

**Operation Methods**:
- Volume Up key: Select option up
- Volume Down key: Select option down
- Power key: Confirm selection

The script automatically detects current system language and displays corresponding Chinese or English interface.

**Module Files**:
- Game mode status: `/data/adb/gpu_governor/game/game_mode` (1=enabled, 0=disabled)
- Log level setting: `/data/adb/gpu_governor/log/log_level`
- Game list configuration: `/data/adb/gpu_governor/game/games.conf`
- Process ID management: `/data/adb/gpu_governor/gpu_governor.pid`

### Log Level Settings

Log level settings are saved in the `/data/adb/gpu_governor/log/log_level` file, defaulting to `info` level. Can be set through three methods:
1. Use interactive menu `./action.sh` to select log level
2. Adjust through WebUI interface settings page
3. Directly edit `/data/adb/gpu_governor/log/log_level` file

Log level changes take effect immediately without needing to restart the module.

### Load Threshold Settings

The module internally implements an intelligent multi-level load threshold system for precise GPU frequency adjustment. The system automatically adjusts thresholds based on current mode:

**Normal Mode** (default load thresholds: 10/30/70/90):
- **Very Low Load**: Below 10%, reduce frequency to save power, supports deep power saving
- **Low Load**: 10-30%, appropriately reduce frequency, maintain basic performance
- **Medium Load**: 30-70%, maintain balanced frequency, optimal for daily use
- **High Load**: 70-90%, increase frequency for better performance
- **Very High Load**: Above 90%, use maximum frequency, full output

**Game Mode** (performance load thresholds: 5/20/60/85):
- **Very Low Load**: Below 5%, minimum frequency, save standby power consumption
- **Low Load**: 5-20%, lower frequency, game menu interface
- **Medium Load**: 20-60%, medium frequency, light gaming load
- **High Load**: 60-85%, high frequency, medium to heavy gaming scenarios
- **Very High Load**: Above 85%, maximum frequency, extreme gaming performance

**Advanced Scaling Parameters**:
- **Hysteresis Threshold Mechanism**: Game mode 65%/40%, normal mode 75%/30%, prevents frequency oscillation
- **Debouncing Time Control**: Game mode 10ms/30ms, normal mode 20ms/50ms, ensures stable frequency scaling
- **Adaptive Sampling Algorithm**: Base interval 16ms (approximately 60Hz), dynamically adjusts 8-100ms based on load
- **Load Trend Analysis**: Detects load rising/falling trends for predictive frequency adjustment
- **Margin Adjustment System**: Supports 0-100% frequency calculation margin

## Logging System üìä

Log files are stored in the `/data/adb/gpu_governor/log/` directory, mainly including:

- **gpu_gov.log**: Main log file recording GPU governor running status and frequency adjustment records
- **initsvc.log**: Initialization service log recording module startup process

Log file size is limited to 5MB. When exceeding the limit, automatic rotation occurs to prevent excessive storage usage. During rotation, the original log file is backed up as a `.bak` file and a new log file is created. Log content can be viewed through the WebUI interface or directly through file manager.

### Log Levels

The module supports four log levels, which can be set through the `action.sh` script or WebUI interface:

- **debug**: Debug level, records all detailed information including frequency adjustments, load monitoring, etc.
- **info**: Information level, records normal operation information, default level
- **warn**: Warning level, only records warning and error information
- **error**: Error level, only records error information

Log level settings are saved in the `/data/adb/gpu_governor/log/log_level` file and take effect immediately after modification without needing to restart the module.

### Log Rotation Mechanism

The module implements automatic log rotation mechanism:

1. During rotation, the current log file is backed up as a `.bak` file and a new empty log file is created
2. Necessary rotation is performed each time the module starts

## Uninstallation Method üóëÔ∏è

Uninstall the module through the root manager, or execute the `uninstall.sh` script to clean configuration files. During uninstallation, the following files will be automatically deleted:

- `/data/gpu_freq_table.conf`
- `/data/adb/gpu_governor/` directory and all its contents

## Supported Devices üì±

Supports most MediaTek processors with Mali GPU, including but not limited to:
- Dimensity series (such as D700/D800/D900/D1x00/D8x00/D9000, etc.) where 0 ‚â§ x ‚â§ 2
- Helio series
- MT6xxx series

The module will automatically detect device model and apply suitable configuration.

If your device is not in the support list, the module will use default configuration. You can also manually edit configuration files to adapt to your device.
